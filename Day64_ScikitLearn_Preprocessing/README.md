# Day 64 – Data Preprocessing & Feature Scaling in Scikit-Learn

Today I explored **data preprocessing and feature scaling** techniques in Scikit-Learn.  
Preprocessing ensures that features are on comparable scales, which improves model performance.

--- 

##  Topics Covered
- Why data preprocessing is important
- Standardization using `StandardScaler`
- Normalization/MinMax scaling using `MinMaxScaler`
- Applying transformations to train and test sets

##  Files
- `Day64_ScikitLearn_Preprocessing.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with code and explanations  
- `Day64_ScikitLearn_Preprocessing.html` – Exported HTML version

##  Next Steps
- Learn about encoding categorical features (One-Hot Encoding)
- Build preprocessing pipelines for combined transformations
