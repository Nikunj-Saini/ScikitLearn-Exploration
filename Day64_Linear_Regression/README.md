# Day 64 – Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn

Today, I learned how to implement **Linear Regression**, one of the most fundamental supervised learning algorithms in machine learning.

##  What I Learned
- The goal of Linear Regression is to find the best-fitting line that predicts `y` from `X`.
- Used Scikit-Learn’s `LinearRegression` class.
- Learned how to:
  - Split dataset into training and testing sets
  - Fit the model using `.fit()`
  - Predict with `.predict()`
  - Evaluate results using R², MSE, and MAE
- Visualized predictions using Matplotlib for better understanding.

##  Code Summary
- Used the **Boston Housing dataset** (or synthetic data from `make_regression`)  
- Trained a model to predict house prices based on features.
- Visualized actual vs predicted values.

##  Next Step
Tomorrow, I’ll learn about **Polynomial Regression** and **Feature Engineering** to improve model accuracy.
