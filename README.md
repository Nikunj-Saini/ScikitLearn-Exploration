# Scikit-Learn Machine Learning Journey

This repository documents my step-by-step learning of **Scikit-Learn**, Python’s most widely used machine learning library for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
It contains daily notebooks, examples, mini-projects, and insights gained during the journey.

## What’s Inside
- Day-wise Jupyter Notebooks (`DayXX_Topic.ipynb`)
- Exported HTML versions of each notebook
- Mini projects for real-world machine learning practice
- README for each day summarizing key learnings

## Learning Goals
- Understand Scikit-Learn’s API and module structure.
- Learn how to load datasets, preprocess data, and split into train/test sets.
- Explore supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.
- Evaluate models and tune hyperparameters.
- Build end-to-end machine learning workflows.

## Topics Covered (Planned)
1. Introduction & Setup
2. Loading Datasets and Train/Test Split
3. Data Preprocessing & Feature Scaling
4. Supervised Learning Algorithms (Regression & Classification)
5. Unsupervised Learning Algorithms (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
6. Model Evaluation & Cross-Validation
7. Hyperparameter Tuning & Pipelines
8. Mini Projects

## End Goal
To be confident in using Scikit-Learn for **data preprocessing**, **model building**, **evaluation**, and **deployment-ready machine learning workflows**.
