# Day 63 – Introduction to Scikit-Learn

This notebook marks the beginning of my **Scikit-Learn Machine Learning Journey**.  
On Day 63, I learned how to load built-in datasets, convert them into Pandas DataFrames, and perform a simple train/test split — the foundation for all upcoming machine learning tasks.
