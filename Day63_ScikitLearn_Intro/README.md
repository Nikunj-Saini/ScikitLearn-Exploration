# Day 63 – Introduction to Scikit-Learn

Today marks the beginning of my **Scikit-Learn journey**, one of the most powerful and widely used libraries for machine learning in Python.

##  What I Learned
- Scikit-Learn provides a simple and consistent API for building ML models.
- The basic ML workflow:  
  **Load Data → Split Data → Train Model → Evaluate Model → Predict**
- How to load built-in datasets using `sklearn.datasets`.
- How to split data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.

##  Code Summary
- Used the `Iris` dataset to explore dataset structure.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Understood the basic idea of features (`X`) and target labels (`y`).

##  Next Step
Tomorrow, I’ll start with **Supervised Learning Models**, focusing on **Linear Regression**.
