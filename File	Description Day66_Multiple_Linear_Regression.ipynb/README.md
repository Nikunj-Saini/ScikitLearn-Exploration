# Day 66 – Multiple Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn

Today, I learned how to perform **Multiple Linear Regression**, which is used when the target variable depends on **more than one feature**.

##  What I Learned
- Multiple Linear Regression models relationships between several predictors (`X1, X2, ...`) and the target (`y`).
- Implemented using Scikit-Learn’s `LinearRegression`.
- Learned how to:
  - Create multi-feature datasets
  - Fit the regression model
  - Evaluate performance using R², MAE, and MSE
  - Interpret coefficients for each feature

##  Code Summary
- Used `make_regression()` to generate a dataset with multiple features.
- Trained and tested the model using `train_test_split`.
- Visualized actual vs predicted values and examined model coefficients.

##  Next Step
Tomorrow, I’ll explore **Ridge & Lasso Regression** to handle overfitting and improve model generalization.
